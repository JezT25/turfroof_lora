# WIP! [todo: setup repository :)]

# LoRa Turf Roof Sensor

1. test for range in HÍ
1.5 adjust SF in code (maybe no need)
3. calibrate actual soil moisture (for cloud)
4. compare data with MET

### Open Questions
- Evaluate waterproofing solutions for the sensor hardware.

## Project To-Do
### Low Priority
- Implement a special LoRa command to prevent the device from entering sleep mode, and add a command to return it to sleep mode.
- Monitor the number of message retransmissions ("bounces") to detect potential issues.
- Graph backoff and timeout events for inclusion in the thesis.

### Procurement
- Purchase additional 18650 batteries (Hafnarfjörður).
- Acquire coin cell batteries.
